0. "Do all of these functions together constitute a meaningful functional unit in the brain? Could one actually point to a place in the brain (or a network of such places) as the seat of human responsibility? We believe that the answer to these last two questions is yes." \[pp. 10\] (2020-04-20T05:02:06Z)

1. "what is sometimes called the “medical model” of legal insanity: If a defendant is judged to have been psychotic at the time he or she committed a criminal act, then that defendant is to be excused from punishment (Moore 2014)" \[pp. 16\] (2020-04-20T05:04:40Z)

2. "calculated" \[pp. 16\] (2020-04-20T05:04:57Z)

> > > Note: Is calculated == premeditated == intentional?

3. "What was the state of Anders Breivik’s sanity at the time of his crime, and how and why does the answer to that question matter?" \[pp. 16\] (2020-04-20T05:05:20Z)

> > > Note: The real question is how would we know? How do you measure and prove such a thing?

4. "He claims that the brains of psychopaths show distinctive patterns of dysfunction and decreased activity, particularly in areas responsible for integrating emotion with cognition, which explain why psychopaths often appear to be devoid of empathy, remorse, or sensitivity to the harms they cause." \[pp. 18\] (2020-04-20T05:06:05Z)

5. "The prosecution argues that allowing Kiehl to testify using the actual brain scans could unduly bias the jury, while the defense argues that the scans are necessary for a complete and accurate picture of Dugan’s mental state." \[pp. 18\] (2020-04-20T05:06:18Z)

> > > Note: This is interesting! Scientific research == gold standard of proof??

6. "argue that a brain scan taken 26 years after the crime in question can hardly illuminate Dugan’s mental state at the time of Nicarico’s murder" \[pp. 19\] (2020-04-20T05:07:00Z)

> > > Note: Fair enough

7. "Even if Kiehl had ironclad evidence of Dugan’s psychopathy—not just now but back in 1983—there should be serious doubts about whether psychopathy should eo ipso mitigate a defendant’s blameworthiness in the eyes of the law" \[pp. 19\] (2020-04-20T05:07:14Z)

> > > Note: Hmm. Why? Because it seems like the issue with blame is about how the other feels…

8. "Dugan told reporters from the Chicago Tribune that he still felt he was a danger to society, prone to intense and uncontrollable rage." \[pp. 19\] (2020-04-20T05:08:08Z)

> > > Note: This seems contrary to the psychiatric sketch of the psychopath…so much self-awareness and empathy for others….

9. "“I was driven by some kind of an impulse that kept growing. I could not stop”" \[pp. 19\] (2020-04-20T05:07:54Z)

10. "To what extent do psychopaths understand the wrongness or harmfulness of their actions?" \[pp. 20\] (2020-04-20T05:08:49Z)

> > > Note: How can we know?

11. "What are the cognitive and neurological signatures of psychopathy? What sorts of evidence from psychiatry and neuroscience would indicate that a defendant was psychopathic, and should that same evidence tend to reduce, or excuse the defendant from, culpability?" \[pp. 20\] (2020-04-20T05:09:10Z)

> > > Note: I feel like there is a difference between justice and responsibility…

12. "They are cases where pertinent-seeming facts about the agents’ minds muddle the intuitions about agency and intent that underpin attributions of responsibility and, therefore, blame" \[pp. 20\] (2020-04-20T05:09:59Z)

13. "However, the victim of the theft claims Bob took the briefcase intentionally and is malingering (is just pretending he has Alzheimer’s). If new brain imaging techniques allowed a medical specialist to provide good evidence of plaque buildup or tangles in Bob’s brain, this would obviously be relevant to his excuse." \[pp. 21\] (2020-04-20T05:10:13Z)

> > > Note: Seems like law needs to decide whether people are inherently good…also, what about pathological liars?

14. "We think the pertinent question is not whether brain science can inform responsibility assessments, but in which sorts of cases, and to what extent." \[pp. 21\] (2020-04-20T05:10:54Z)

> > > Note: Hmmm

15. "Stephen Morse, for example, worries about the spread of “brain overclaim syndrome” (Morse 2006a) into the legal realm. Morse argues that some commentators allow their enthusiasm for the fast-moving world of neuroscience, with its seductive fMRI images and buzzy breakthroughs, to lead them astray. They apply neuropsychological findings incautiously and overestimate their true relevance to questions of criminal responsibility." \[pp. 21\] (2020-04-20T05:11:31Z)

> > > Note: That is fair, especially considering the fact that fMRI is simply a representation of the brain not actually a snapshot of the brain.

16. "At most, the neuroscientific evidence provides a partial causal explanation of why the observed behavioral differences exist and thus some further evidence of the validity of the behavioral differences." \[pp. 22\] (2020-04-20T05:12:15Z)

17. "We would caution against thinking of brain and mind as two separate but causally related entities, though, and suggest that a good portion of the mystery derives from this thinking. But luckily, we will argue, we need not enter into such metaphysical disputes in order to develop an effective and sound approach to responsibility grounded in science" \[pp. 22\] (2020-04-20T05:12:27Z)

> > > Note: Hmm!

18. "our remarkable abilities to be responsible derive from these cognitive functions, rather than our equally remarkable ability to be conscious." \[pp. 22\] (2020-04-20T05:12:47Z)

> > > Note: !!!

19. "Scholars harboring these concerns tend to see our everyday folkpsychological responsibility assessments as deeply committed to a libertarian conception of free will, which is threatened by the findings emerging from brain science. 8 If their view is accurate, then a complete neuroscientific understanding of human agency might well supplant our cherished commonsense notions of free will, agency, and responsibility, which ground our legal practices of blame and punishment. This may then lead to verdicts about responsibility that differ strongly from our commonsense notions of who should be held responsible. A prominent line of conjecture holds that neuroscientific data may require us to shift away from retributive (blame-based) punishment and toward a rationale for punishment that is exclusively concerned with deterrence and/or rehabilitation. 9" \[pp. 23\] (2020-04-20T05:13:13Z)

> > > Note: This is so important! The danger of black-and-white thinking offered by neuroscience is that it lends itself nicely to a punitive justice system.

20. "the folk-psychological concepts that underpin assessments of responsibility—where mental capacities and states are attributed to an agent to determine the level of praise or blame that constitutes an appropriate response to a particular action—do not seem to be undermined by the brute fact that these capacities and states are realized in the brain (which is a physical object subject to certain deterministic rules or laws)." \[pp. 23\] (2020-04-20T05:14:21Z)

21. "under other similar circumstances the person would have recognized the relevance of the reason to his or her actions, possibly causing the person to inhibit the action altogether." \[pp. 24\] (2020-04-20T05:14:30Z)

> > > Note: Counterfactual reasons account and reason responsiveness —> see Gary Watson for rationale against this.

22. "Neuroscience is both relevant to responsibility and consistent with our ordinary “folk” conceptions of it." \[pp. 24\] (2020-04-20T05:15:20Z)

> > > Note: THESIS

23. "The criminal law, as a high-stakes repository of folk-psychological judgments about responsibility, carries an implicit commitment to a view of human agency as basically free and reason-based." \[pp. 24\] (2020-04-20T05:15:39Z)

> > > Note: True! Which is peculiar considering the origins of most legal systems….take the US for example…aren’t we all born with original sin??

24. "We will offer, in Roskies’s terms, a sophisticated view of responsibility that can both serve our folk and legal purposes and be reconciled with and reinforced by a mature scientific understanding of the brain" \[pp. 25\] (2020-04-20T05:16:41Z)

25. "Executive functions—such as attentional control, planning, inhibition, and task switching—are therefore uniquely well suited to ground a reasons-responsiveness account of the capacities necessary for moral responsibility, including both sensitivity to morally or legally relevant reasons and the volitional control to act in accordance with those reasons." \[pp. 25\] (2020-04-20T05:16:51Z)

26. "we find that legal responsibility is contingent upon a person’s having the capacity for some baseline level of executive function, either at the time a crime is committed or for some significant period of time before the crime." \[pp. 25\] (2020-04-20T05:17:04Z)

27. "If this body of scientific theory and experimental evidence is correct, here" \[pp. 29\] (2020-04-20T05:17:42Z)

28. "is one implication it has for our understanding of the human capacity for responsibility." \[pp. 30\] (2020-04-20T05:17:46Z)

29. "there is strong scientific evidence for the existence of executive processes, and that the notion of executive processes will itself become an important part of the neuroscientific theory of the brain." \[pp. 30\] (2020-04-20T05:17:55Z)

> > > Note: Point of the chapter

30. "brain function from neuroscience is that there is a fundamental distinction in the way the brain treats routine as opposed to novel situations." \[pp. 30\] (2020-04-20T05:19:43Z)

31. "hese sorts of novel, complex tasks recruit an organized set of processes that form a network located primarily in the brain’s prefrontal lobes known as executive processes or cognitive control processes" \[pp. 30\] (2020-04-20T05:20:01Z)

> > > Note: Behavioral plasticity


32. "human beings’ robust suite of executive functions allows us not only to behave flexibly, but to exert self-control—to guide our actions in complex ways, taking account of input from our senses, or from memory, but also from our emotions and values." \[pp. 30\] (2020-04-20T05:20:21Z)

> > > Note: Self-control requires establishing intention. Have they really proven that an animal does not intend to do something??

33. "Neuroscientists draw a rough but defensible line in the brain between, on the one hand, perceptual processes and, on the other hand, executive processes that can correct perceptions and formulate intentions based on perceptual input." \[pp. 31\] (2020-04-20T05:21:14Z)

34. "Memory and emotional processing are functionally and anatomically separate from executive processing although they interact closely" \[pp. 31\] (2020-04-20T05:21:33Z)

> > > Note: This assumes a very divided brain. But I feel like there has been a growing canon of literature pointing to the contrary…

35. "Current large-scale brain theory in neuroscience continues to make and employ clear distinctions between sensory, mnemonic, and emotional networks and their constituent areas, on the one hand, and executive network areas devoted to cognitive control on the other. Ideally, the executive processes take all three—current perceptions, along with relevant memories and" \[pp. 31\] (2020-04-20T05:22:31Z)

36. "emotions—into account in formulating intentions to act and then monitoring and guiding the subsequent behavior." \[pp. 32\] (2020-04-20T05:22:35Z)

37. "Our control over our abilities to perceive, remember, and emote has certain concrete limits, which is itself another sign of the fundamental separateness of these abilities from the processes that do the controlling" \[pp. 32\] (2020-04-20T05:23:01Z)

38. "He can use executive processing to correct for a perceptual deficit." \[pp. 32\] (2020-04-20T05:23:22Z)

> > > Note: Repurposing the brain

39. "We hold people responsible for actions that arise from failures to correct certain problems when we believe they could have done so. Echoing this folk sentiment, one of the primary claims of this book will be that only brain damage—or any sort of suboptimal brain functioning—that causes deficits that cannot be corrected for by the executive processes are grounds for moral or legal excuse." \[pp. 32\] (2020-04-20T05:23:47Z)

> > > Note: That’s true. There’s a threshold of control one is assumed to have…

40. "We will argue that certain schizophrenics may be excused from their violent acts because they can no longer identify and correct for hallucinations and violent impulses to cause harm" \[pp. 32\] (2020-04-20T05:24:39Z)

> > > Note: Schism with self?

41. "The combination of the two sorts of deficits may be at the root of the schizophrenic’s harmful behavior, but it is the higher-level executive deficits that are exculpatory, according to our view." \[pp. 33\] (2020-04-20T05:25:04Z)

42. "Imaging studies began to find, however, that different executive tasks recruited similar sets of cortical areas" \[pp. 33\] (2020-04-20T05:25:21Z)

43. "such double dissociations provide evidence that the two functions are performed by two different brain processes" \[pp. 33\] (2020-04-20T05:25:31Z)

44. "ppears to show that all executive functions (or at least a core set of them) are accomplished by a single, unified brain network, the frontoparietal cognitive control network (working together with adjunctive areas, some of which are unique to the particular executive process involved)" \[pp. 33\] (2020-04-20T05:25:40Z)

45. "“Cognitive control network” is the name of a physical set of interconnected brain area and organs." \[pp. 34\] (2020-04-20T05:25:53Z)

49. "Stuss and Alexander (2007), for example, argue that three different executive functions map onto three different prefrontal areas that can be damaged independently of one another." \[pp. 35\] (2020-04-20T05:27:35Z)

50. "his may shed light on the nature of the loss of executive function: General loss might follow from lesion of one of the core frontoparietal areas" \[pp. 35\] (2020-04-20T05:27:48Z)

51. "some authors speak of vigilance (e.g., Niendam et al. 2012) while others speak of monitoring ." \[pp. 36\] (2020-04-20T05:28:25Z)

52. "Top-down attention is considered to be under voluntary control, as opposed to bottomup attention, in which our attention is involuntarily drawn to movement in the periphery of the visual field, for example (Posner 2011)" \[pp. 36\] (2020-04-20T05:29:11Z)

56. "Attention and monitoring during behavior seem particularly important for culpable action." \[pp. 37\] (2020-04-20T05:30:40Z)

57. "Intentional actions in general are monitored during their execution, and this monitoring is a type of attention, that is, paying attention to what you are doing." \[pp. 37\] (2020-04-20T05:30:47Z)

58. "hese monitored actions are the opposite of routine actions, and also different from actions in “flow” states, which we will argue also lack executive involvement." \[pp. 37\] (2020-04-20T05:31:15Z)

59. "they are treating the mnemonic store together with the areas that manipulate it and update it, which are more plausibly thought of as executive functions" \[pp. 37\] (2020-04-20T05:31:47Z)

60. "People with dysexecutive syndrome do not make plans for the future." \[pp. 38\] (2020-04-20T05:32:21Z)

61. "Another intriguing symptom shown by some more severe dysexecutive patients that shows how environmentally bound they are is called utilization behavior: They will pick up and use whatever is put in front of them" \[pp. 38\] (2020-04-20T05:32:30Z)

> > > Note: Interesting. Brain is primed by environment…immediately

62. "some writers assign an executive process called initiation (Smith and Jonides 1999, Lezak 1995) to start the behaviors that will realize the plan. Go/no-go experiments involve a decision about whether to act or not, based on the current stimulus." \[pp. 38\] (2020-04-20T05:33:13Z)

63. "inhibition involves the ability to “deliberately inhibit dominant, automatic, or prepotent responses when necessary." \[pp. 38\] (2020-04-20T05:33:53Z)

64. "can result in perseveration, in which individuals continue with a course of action they realize is wrong but cannot stop themselves from engaging in." \[pp. 39\] (2020-04-20T05:34:02Z)

65. "Disinhibition is a neurological condition that occurs when people lose the executive capacity to stop unwise, illegal, unethical, inappropriate, or just ineffective actions from being executed" \[pp. 39\] (2020-04-20T05:34:13Z)

66. "here is no single inhibition area in the brain. Rather, what one sees is that inhibition in different sorts of tasks involves different, although sometimes nearby, brain areas." \[pp. 39\] (2020-04-20T05:34:23Z)

67. "“[T]he executive functions can be thought of as the set of abilities required to effortfully guide behavior toward a goal, especially in nonroutine situations”" \[pp. 39\] (2020-04-20T05:34:48Z)

68. "But the process of decision-making seems too complex to be considered an executive function by itself." \[pp. 40\] (2020-04-20T05:35:10Z)

> > > Note: Interesting

69. "However, the term “decision-making” might work better as an attempt to describe what the executive processes do in general." \[pp. 40\] (2020-04-20T05:35:21Z)

70. "Planning requires attention to perceptual and mnemonic information; it involves inhibition, when a routine response must be stopped or when a candidate plan is inhibited because its simulation resulted in (represented) negative consequences. Testing candidate plans requires working memory, as well as other representational systems." \[pp. 40\] (2020-04-20T05:35:54Z)

71. "Planning also requires the involvement of the brain’s emotion and reward systems" \[pp. 41\] (2020-04-20T05:36:01Z)

72. "Rather than being trapped in the present like simpler organisms, we can transcend the present by keeping a careful record of the past, but also by using our abilities to envisage future events or possible events." \[pp. 41\] (2020-04-20T05:36:17Z)

77. "here are two hubs in this network, forming two subsystems: the dopaminergic reward system and the amygdala. The dopaminergic reward system includes the basal forebrain. The amygdala is primarily associated with the noradrenergic system." \[pp. 47\] (2020-04-20T05:40:34Z)

79. "Spreng et al. (2013) identified three different types of nodes within the cognitive control network: (1) nodes aligned with the dorsal attention network, (2) nodes aligned with the default mode network, and (3) nodes aligned with both networks." \[pp. 47\] (2020-04-20T05:41:18Z)

80. "we might consider our special abilities to understand each other’s minds to have a top-down and bottom-up dimension in relation to the cognitive control network, in much the same way that attention comes in top-down and bottom-up varieties. In their bottom-up mode, mindreading capacities might function like a special type of perception. They can provide us with information about people’s goals and intentions by operating spontaneously. In their top-down mode, mind-reading processes can be activated and engaged by the cognitive control network, when we explicitly and effortfully ask ourselves: How will she react to this? We can then edit our plans and intentions based on our simulation of the other" \[pp. 48\] (2020-04-20T05:41:58Z)

83. "Without this, the human mind seems to be prone to a number of foibles, including self-deception, as well as the fallacy of false equivalency, because the person cannot weigh the difference between say, an accidental nudge and a deliberate punch, or a strong argument and a weak one." \[pp. 50\] (2020-04-20T05:43:46Z)
